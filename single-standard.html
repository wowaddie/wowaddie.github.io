                            <li class="date">June 15, 2023</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p class="lead">
                            Khaled Hosseini is one of the top authors on my list. His debut, The Kite Runner, is my comfort book. After I finished reading it, I read it again and again because I just could not get enough of that book. A Thousand Splendid Suns, his second novel, I adored. The entire book was a rollercoaster of emotions; I smiled, laughed and cried along with the characters in the book. So when one of my friends lent me his third novel- And The Mountains Echoed, I was ecstatic.</p> 

                        <p>Suffice to say, I was a tad bit disappointed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           
                        </p>

                        <p>I never expected the author to churn out such a bland book. It almost feels like a collection of short stories tied up together, plus it was so irritating when the author would focus on a particular character, and shift to another one, just when the story was just about to get interesting. Most of the book was wasted on detailed descriptions of characters who have little to no impact on the story. Compared to his last couple of books, this one was disappointing.
                            Don’t get me wrong, the story is quite moving, and the plot is very interesting, like a rollercoaster ride. Ups and downs. Interesting parts and bland parts. Fast-paced parts and slow parts. This is not really a plot-based story. After writing two striking novels, I don’t think people were expecting this.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Thoughts</h2>

                        <p>The plot itself is amazing - I mean, a brother-sister relationship saga spanning multiple generations and continents? Sign me up! Like I said before, if you really want to enjoy this book, view this as its own book. Forget the other two existed. Pretend that this is your first time experiencing Khaled’s work.

                            It’s pretty difficult to recap the whole thing without giving the entire plot away. There are many stories inside one story and the characters are intertwined, and although most won’t realize it, the plot actually comes full circle at the end.</p>
                            
                            <p>For the first third of the novel, I was swept up in the stories of villagers from Shadbagh. A long letter written by Abdullah’s uncle Nabi was particularly interesting. In fact, that was the only part of the book I really enjoyed. As the book went on, however, I found it harder and harder to get into the flow every time the point of view changed. The last third of the book felt like a battle; whole paragraphs lingered on details about characters that I simply didn’t care about.</p>
                            
                            <p>The ending, however, made me cry. This is a really sad book for people who love sad books. There’s no lovely-dovey and “they lived happily ever after” ending. This book will make you cry. Actual tears. If you don’t, then I'd recommend you check with your doctor to make sure you’re human. So, even though the middle parts are pretty bland, the ending is worth it.</p>
                            
                

                    

                    
                        <h3>Lessons</h3>

                        <p>This novel has lots of lessons too, which I cannot impart to this post without sounding like a rambling idiot. Natalie here on Goodreads has basically summed it up.</p>

                           <p>“We (the human race) have (mostly) good intentions. But we (mostly) do not follow through. We soothe ourselves. We convince ourselves. We justify our actions. Or our lack of actions. We have an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ way of thinking. It’s a human flaw. And sometimes it has consequences that we cannot comprehend. Consequences that we may never realize because, hey, it’s out of sight. Oh sure. Just like him to point out WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME! Not that I’m taking it personally...”</p>

                        <p>Conclusion? Read this book with an open mind and lots of time to spare. Unless you’re a fast reader, this book will take forever to finish. I’m not telling you to not read the book, but after reading this post, you can judge for yourself.
